TRANSCRIPTION_PROMPT = """Transcribe ALL visible content in markdown exactly as shown. Include application names, URLs, file paths, and timestamps.

While transcribing, note ONLY what you can clearly see:
- Application names and window titles
- Visible text content and UI elements
- URLs and file paths that are clearly displayed
- Any timestamps or dates visible on screen

DO NOT make assumptions about:
- Cursor position (unless clearly visible)
- Active window focus (unless obvious from UI)
- User interaction state (unless clearly indicated)
- Temporal context (unless explicitly shown)

Provide complete word-for-word transcription with ONLY observable interface context."""

SUMMARY_PROMPT = """Analyze the screenshots to understand what the user is doing based on clearly visible evidence.

Focus on what you can definitively observe:

**Visible Activity**: What specific actions can you see the user taking? (Only what's clearly visible)

**Content Type**: What type of information/interface is visible? (Based on clearly displayed content)

**Interface Elements**: What UI elements are clearly visible? (Windows, tabs, buttons, etc.)

**Behavioral Context**: What does the visible content suggest about user activity? (Be conservative in interpretation)

IMPORTANT: Only make observations based on clearly visible evidence. If something is unclear or not visible, do not make assumptions about it.

Generate 3-4 specific observations about what you can clearly see the user doing."""
