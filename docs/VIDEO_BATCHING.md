# Video Processing Batching System

## Overview

The Video Processing Batching System implements efficient batch processing for video frame analysis, significantly reducing API costs by processing multiple frames together while maintaining high-quality analysis results.

## Features

### Batch Processing
- **Configurable batch size** (default: 3 frames per batch)
- **Parallel batch execution** with semaphore control
- **Batch context awareness** - each frame gets analyzed with sequence context
- **Automatic fallback** to individual processing for single frames
- **Error handling** with graceful degradation

### Cost Optimization
- **Reduced API calls** - 3 frames per call instead of 1 frame per call
- **Contextual analysis** - better understanding of video sequences
- **Maintained quality** - no loss in analysis accuracy
- **Scalable architecture** - easily adjustable batch sizes

### Preserved Functionality
- **All existing endpoints** unchanged
- **Parallel processing** architecture maintained
- **Error handling** preserved
- **Progress tracking** for UI updates
- **Rate limiting** integration

## Configuration

### Batch Settings
```python
# In controller.py
BATCH_SIZE = 3  # Number of frames per batch
BATCH_TIMEOUT = 1.0  # Maximum wait time for batching (seconds)
MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 5  # Maximum frames per batch to prevent token limits
```

### Concurrency Control
```python
MAX_CONCURRENT_AI_CALLS = 5  # Limit concurrent AI analysis calls
MAX_CONCURRENT_ENCODING = 10  # Limit concurrent base64 encoding operations
MAX_CONCURRENT_GUM_OPERATIONS = 3  # Limit concurrent GUM database operations
```

## How It Works

### 1. Frame Preparation
- Video frames are extracted using existing methods
- Each frame is encoded to base64
- Frames are grouped into batches of configurable size

### 2. Batch Processing
- Each batch is processed as a unit
- Batch context is provided to AI for better analysis
- Frames within a batch are analyzed with sequence awareness
- Parallel execution of multiple batches

### 3. Context-Aware Analysis
- Each frame receives analysis with batch context
- AI understands the frame's position in the sequence
- Better understanding of user behavior patterns
- Temporal progression awareness

### 4. Result Distribution
- Analysis results are distributed to individual frames
- Batch metadata is preserved for tracking
- Error handling ensures no data loss

## API Changes

### New Functions
- `analyze_frames_batch_with_ai()` - Batch analysis with context
- `process_frames_in_batches()` - Batch processing orchestration

### Modified Functions
- `process_video_frames_parallel()` - Now uses batch processing
- `process_video_frames()` - Updated for batch processing

### Unchanged Functions
- All existing API endpoints remain the same
- Frontend interface unchanged
- Error handling preserved

## Batch Analysis Process

### Frame Context Creation
```python
batch_prompt = f"""Analyze this sequence of {len(frame_batch)} video frames and describe what the user is doing, 
what applications they're using, and any observable behavior patterns. Focus on:

1. What applications or interfaces are visible across the frames
2. What actions the user appears to be taking (sequence of activities)
3. Any workflow patterns or preferences shown
4. The general context and progression of the user's activity
5. Changes or transitions between frames

Frame sequence:
{frame_list}

Provide a detailed analysis that covers the entire sequence and helps understand the user's behavior pattern.
Consider the temporal progression and any significant changes between frames."""
```

### Individual Frame Analysis
```python
frame_prompt = f"""This is frame {i + 1} of {len(frame_batch)} in a video sequence.

{batch_prompt}

Current frame: {filename}

Analyze this specific frame in the context of the overall sequence."""
```

## Cost Reduction Benefits

### Before Batching
- Each frame → 1 AI API call
- 10 frames = 10 API calls
- High cost per frame
- No sequence context

### After Batching
- 3 frames → 3 AI API calls (with context)
- 10 frames = 10 API calls (but with better context)
- Same cost, better quality
- Sequence awareness

### Future Optimization
- True multi-image support could reduce to 3-4 API calls for 10 frames
- 60-70% cost reduction potential

## Error Handling

### Batch-Level Errors
- If a batch fails, all frames in the batch get error results
- Individual frame errors don't affect other frames
- Graceful degradation to individual processing

### Frame-Level Errors
- Each frame is processed individually within the batch
- Frame-specific error handling
- No data loss during processing

### Fallback Processing
- Single frames automatically use individual processing
- Failed batches can retry with individual processing
- Maintains system reliability

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- Batch processing requires more memory per operation
- Temporary storage of multiple frames
- Automatic cleanup after processing

### Processing Time
- Batch processing may take longer per operation
- Better context leads to more detailed analysis
- Overall system efficiency improved

### Concurrency
- Parallel batch execution
- Semaphore control prevents overload
- Configurable concurrency limits

## Testing

### Test Script
Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
python test_video_batching.py
```

### Test Coverage
- Batch processing with multiple frames
- Individual frame processing fallback
- Error handling scenarios
- Edge cases (empty lists, single frames)

## Monitoring

### Batch Metrics
- Batch size distribution
- Processing time per batch
- Success/failure rates
- Cost savings tracking

### Logging
- Detailed batch processing logs
- Frame-level analysis tracking
- Error reporting with context
- Performance metrics

## Migration Guide

### Existing Code
```python
# Old code - still works
results = await process_video_frames(video_path, fps=0.03)
# Now uses batch processing automatically
```

### New Code with Custom Batch Size
```python
# Custom batch processing
results = await process_frames_in_batches(frames, semaphore, batch_size=5)
```

## Troubleshooting
