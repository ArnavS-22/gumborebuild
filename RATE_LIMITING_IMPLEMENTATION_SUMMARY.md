- Detailed logging with client IP addresses
- Admin endpoints for monitoring (`/admin/rate-limits`) and management (`/admin/rate-limits/reset`)
- Exclusions for health checks and static files

### 3. Enhanced Frontend Rate Limiting (`frontend/static/js/app.js`)

**Before:**

- Visual progress bars showing remaining requests
- Automatic cleanup of expired rate limits
- Success notifications when limits reset
- Support for all rate-limited endpoints

### 4. Enhanced UI/UX (`frontend/static/css/styles.css`)

**Before:**
- Basic disabled button styles
- Simple warning messages
- No visual indicators

**After:**
- **Comprehensive rate limiting UI** with multiple visual states
- **Animated countdown indicators** with progress bars
- **Rate-limited button styling** with shimmer effects
- **Dark mode support** for all rate limiting elements
- **Responsive design** for mobile devices

**Key Features:**
- Distinct styling for rate-limited buttons

- Animated countdown timers
- Toast notifications for rate limit events
- Dark mode support for all elements
- Mobile-responsive design

## Configuration

### Default Rate Limits

| Endpoint | Limit | Window | Description |
|----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/observations/video` | 5 requests | 5 minutes | Video uploads (resource-intensive) |
| `/observations/text` | 20 requests | 1 minute | Text submissions |
| `/query` | 30 requests | 1 minute | Search queries |
| `default` | 100 requests | 1 minute | All other endpoints |

### Advanced Configuration

The rate limiter supports advanced configuration options:

```python
rate_limiter.configure_endpoint(
    endpoint="/custom/endpoint",
    max_requests=50,
    window_seconds=120,
    cleanup_interval=300,      # Cleanup every 5 minutes
    max_memory_entries=5000    # Keep max 5000 entries in memory
)
```

## API Endpoints

### Rate Limit Headers

All API responses now include rate limit headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 20
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 15
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

### Admin Endpoints

- **GET `/admin/rate-limits`** - Get comprehensive rate limiting statistics
- **POST `/admin/rate-limits/reset`** - Reset rate limits for specific endpoint or all endpoints

## Monitoring and Logging

### Log Messages

The system now logs detailed information:

```
INFO: Configured rate limit for /observations/video: 5 requests per 300s
WARNING: Rate limit exceeded for /observations/video: 5/5 requests in 300s window. Reset in 245s. Client IP: 192.168.1.100
INFO: High usage for /query: 4 requests remaining out of 30
INFO: Cleanup completed: 23 requests, 2 endpoints removed
```

### Metrics Tracked

- Total requests processed
- Rate-limited requests count
- Cleanup operations performed
- Memory usage (total entries)
- Rate limit violation percentage
- Per-endpoint statistics

## Frontend Features

### Rate Limit Status

```javascript
// Check if endpoint is rate limited
if (gumApp.isRateLimited('/observations/video')) {
    console.log('Video upload is rate limited');
}

// Get rate limit information
const status = gumApp.getRateLimitStatus('/observations/video');
if (status) {
    console.log(`Reset in ${Math.ceil((status.resetTime - Date.now()) / 1000)}s`);
}
```

### Visual Indicators

- **Countdown timers** on disabled buttons
- **Progress bars** showing remaining requests
- **Toast notifications** for rate limit events
- **Animated effects** for better user experience

## Testing
